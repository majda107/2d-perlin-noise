# Perlin-noise generator (and OpenGL visualiser...)

Since I needed a perlin noise generator for my projects, I decided to write one by my own.

NOTE: *This is not a full-version of perlin noise generator rather than pseudo-one*

Don't look at the Game.cs part, just for test and visualizing purposes...

* **1-2** change 2D/3D mode
* **o** - change octave
* **b** - change bias
* **h** - change height
* **r** - change noise resolution
* **+/-** - zoom
