# (Psedo) Perlin-noise generator
## and visualiser...

Since I needed a perlin-noise generator for my projects, I decided to write one by my own.

Don't look at the Game.cs part, just for test and visualizing purposes...

* **1-2** change mode
* **o** - change octave
* **b** - change bias
* **h** - change height
* **r** - change noise resolution
* **+/-** - zoom
